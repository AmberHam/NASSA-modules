# Random walk in 2D space based on agent angle orientation
*by Andreas Angourakis* (NASSA submission :rocket:)

An implementation of random walk in Python, which defines an agent class `Walker` capable of several movement algorithms based on angle and movement step distance in a continuous 2D space.
