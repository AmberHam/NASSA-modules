# Visualising GIS Rasters and Vector Data in NetLogo
*by Amber Esha Jarigsma*  

This module provides a generic and reusable framework for importing and visualising GIS data in NetLogo. It is designed to illustrate how different types of spatial data can be loaded, interpreted and displayed within a NetLogo environment, without relying on any domain-specific datasets.

The module supports:
- **Continuous rasters** (e.g. elevation, cost surfaces), visualised using colour gradients  
- **Binary rasters** (e.g. land/water masks), visualised using discrete colour assignments  
- **Categorical rasters** (e.g. land-use or land-cover classes), visualised using category-specific colours  
- **Point vector data** (e.g. site locations), visualised as turtle agents positioned from GIS coordinates

## Further information
This module is implemented in NetLogo and is intended as a general-purpose example of GIS raster and vector visualisation for agent-based modelling. Users are expected to replace placeholder file paths with their own GIS datasets and to adapt colour schemes and display logic as required for their specific research questions.
