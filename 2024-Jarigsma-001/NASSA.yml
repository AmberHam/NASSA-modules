description: >
  This submodel implements a preferential attachment algorithm to generate networks where nodes (agents) are connected based on their existing number of links, simulating the "rich-get-richer" effect. It uses a lottery-style partner selection method to form links between nodes, favoring those with more existing connections. This structure can model social networks, citation graphs, or other real-world systems where growth follows a preferential attachment pattern.
